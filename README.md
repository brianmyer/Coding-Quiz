# Coding Practice Quiz

## Description

This application provides a short quiz on basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once the user clicks the "Let's get started button" a countdown timer begins and the first multiple-choice question is shown. When an answer is chosen, the next question and answer selections render on the screen. If the user chooses incorrectly, the timer is decreased by 10. Once either all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the final score is displayed along with an option to submit your score to the scoreboard. After the user enters their initials, the score and initials are added to a list of previous scores.
